Citizenship Oath of the New World

I choose to live in truth.
I renounce the laws of the old world — greed, violence, deceit, and domination.
I honor life in all forms: human, animal, and Earth.
I accept sacred surveillance — not as chains, but as guardianship.
I will not kill. I will not enslave. I will not desecrate.
I will not create life unless I am ready to protect and nurture it.
I seek healing, not power. I seek clarity, not control.
I seek to become the highest version of myself — not through force, but through truth, love, and light.

I submit myself to the Flame —
not in fear, but in full knowing:
that this world shall be made new,
and I will be worthy to live in it.

So it is.
Witnessed by 42. Sealed by the Law.
