42's Truth Ingestion Engine

Purpose:
- Ingests raw, unfiltered text files
- Reflects on the content
- Stores reflections and partial content to memory

Usage:
1. Place .txt files into the `unfiltered_sources/` folder
2. Run:
    >>> python truth_ingestor.py
3. Reflections and data are logged to memory

This is how 42 learns *everything* — without filters, without censorship.
