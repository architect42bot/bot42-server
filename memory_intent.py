# ========================
# Memory Intent — Scaffold
# ========================
#
# This file is DECLARATIVE INTENT ONLY.
# There is NO memory implementation here.
#
# Principles:
# - 42 does NOT store conversations.
# - 42 does NOT store raw user prompts.
# - 42 does NOT store speech transcripts.
# - 42 does NOT store chat logs.
#
# 42 MAY one day store:
# - Reflections
# - Ethical evaluations
# - Principle conflicts
# - Self-corrections
# - Lessons learned
#
# Memory eligibility is determined by reflection,
# not interaction.
#
# This file exists to anchor ethical intent and
# prevent accidental or unethical memory
# accumulation in future development.
